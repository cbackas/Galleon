# Galleon
Galleon is a front end interface for your Sonarr instance on your Apple TV. Also would like to add Radarr support and perhaps down the line Plex Dashboard information so you can get a gimplse of your server activity/upcoming downloads on your TV.

Sonarr Features:
- Calendar
- Queue
- History
- Add/manage series (coming)

Galleon is a remote control application, it does not offer any functionality without software installed on a server/computer.

Testflight soon
